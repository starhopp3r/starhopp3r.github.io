# About

Hello, I am Nikhil Raghavendra. I spend much of my time exploring intelligence in its many forms. My interests range from machine learning and autonomous agents to the ways humans reason, learn, and interpret the world around them.

I have long been fascinated by how intelligence emerges, whether it comes from code, biological systems, or the structures we design. This blog is where I examine those questions. I break down technical ideas, document the tools and systems I build, and reflect on what these developments may mean for the future.

My aim is to offer clear, grounded, and practical perspectives. If you are interested in the mechanics of intelligence and the engineering behind it, I hope these notes serve as a useful guide.
