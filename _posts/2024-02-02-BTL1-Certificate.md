Through this strategic and comprehensive approach to lab investigations on BTLO, I was able to equip myself with the necessary skills and mindset to tackle the 24-hour Incident Response Exam successfully.

## Attending the 24-hour Incident Response Exam

Embarking on the 24-hour Incident Response Exam is a formidable challenge that demands not just knowledge and skill but also meticulous planning and discipline. Recognizing the inexorable nature of the exam's timer, I meticulously strategized my approach, segmenting the 24-hour timeframe to incorporate intervals for sanity checks, rest, meals, and sleep. This structured plan was not just about managing time; it was about maintaining mental clarity and resilience throughout the rigorous exam.

As dawn broke on the day of the exam, I found myself seated at my desk, freshly fueled by breakfast and ready to tackle the challenge ahead. It was 9 am when I initiated the exam, diving into the scenario that unfolded on my screen. The exam is inherently scenario-based, making it imperative to comprehend every nuance and intricacy of the given situation. This initial phase of thorough understanding set the tone for the rest of my exam journey.

Contrary to my plan of utilizing the full 24-hour window, my flow and focus propelled me to complete the exam by 6 pm on the same day. However, not one to leave things to chance, I invested an additional hour in a final sanity check, meticulously reviewing my responses before submitting my answers.

## Reflections and Revelations

The moment of truth arrived with my score: an impressive 80%. While this marked a significant achievement of answering 16 out of 20 questions correctly, a tinge of 'what if' lingered – I was a mere two questions shy of the gold challenge coin. The detailed feedback was enlightening; it revealed a pivotal oversight – the incorrect application of a filter in Splunk, leading to erroneous answers for two crucial questions. This introspection was not just about pinpointing mistakes but about learning and evolving.
