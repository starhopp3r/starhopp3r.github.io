Hello and welcome! I'm Nikhil (cyber moniker: Malware Mystic) and let me tell you a bit about myself and my journey in this dynamic field. My journey started when I received my Blue Team Level 1 certification. This achievement served as a launchpad for me, fueling my fascination with defense strategies, fortifying infrastructures, and delving deep into cybersecurity's preventive side.

While my Blue Team certification armed me with invaluable skills in identifying threats and securing network systems, I'm currently expanding my knowledge horizon towards 'Red Teaming' and offensive security. I'm a firm believer in the adage that to truly safeguard any system, one must think like an attacker. Therefore, my present learning path involves understanding offensive security measures, including penetration testing and system vulnerabilities exploration.

In addition to this, I've been sinking my teeth into malware development and its application in penetration testing. Uncovering how these malicious codes operate and can be used in a controlled and ethical environment for security assessments is a thrilling journey that I wish to share with you.

My future learning objective? SCADA/ICS (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition/Industrial Control Systems) networks. Given their significant role in managing infrastructure on local and national levels, securing these networks is more important than ever in this digital age. My aim is to gain expertise in this area, understanding how these systems can be fortified to prevent catastrophic breaches that could impact thousands of lives.

My goal with this blog is to build a community of learners and enthusiasts like me. I aim to share my journey, discoveries, and insights, hoping to ignite curiosity, knowledge, and the spirit of cybersecurity in all of you. I want this platform to serve as an interactive space where ideas can be exchanged, knowledge can be shared, and together, we can contribute to a more secure digital world.

I invite you to join me on this exciting journey. Stay secure!
